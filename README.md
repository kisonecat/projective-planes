# projective planes

This is a talk that I gave at [Radical Pi](http://www.math.osu.edu/undergraduate/radicalpi) and then at 
[the Undergraduate Mathematics Symposium (UMS) at the University of Illinois at Chicago](http://www.math.uic.edu/ums/) on October 5, 2013.

## Abstract

Given a field (a number system), we can build a "geometry"---something
with points and lines.  For instance, starting with the field of real
numbers, we consider pairs of reals, and we get the Cartesian plane.

But what if, instead of starting with the field, we instead started
with a geometry?  Could we, from the points and lines, recover a
field?  Sometimes. yes!  The geometries we start with will be
"projective geometries" where any two lines meet (maybe "at
infinity").  How do we get a field?  Commutativity of
multiplication---among the other axioms for a field---then turn into
gloriously complicated diagrams of points and lines.  Desargues'
theorem and Pappus' theorem show up to save the day.

A reference for the above is Hilbert's Grundlagen der Geometrie.  I'll
end with some directions for undergraduate research, and a brief
synopsis of a project of mine that deals with projective planes.
